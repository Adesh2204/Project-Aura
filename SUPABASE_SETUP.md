# Supabase Backend Setup Guide for Project Aura

This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase as the backend for your Project Aura React application.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (free tier available at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
- Node.js and npm installed
- Basic knowledge of SQL and database concepts

## Step 1: Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in/sign up
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization
4. Fill in project details:
   - **Name**: `project-aura` (or your preferred name)
   - **Database Password**: Choose a strong password (save this!)
   - **Region**: Choose the closest region to your users
5. Click "Create new project"
6. Wait for the project to be created (this may take a few minutes)

## Step 2: Get Your Project Credentials

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **Anon public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in your project root (copy from `env.example`)
2. Add your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
```

## Step 4: Set Up the Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run the migration files in order:

### First, run the initial schema migration:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
```

### Then, run the storage buckets migration:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of supabase/migrations/002_storage_buckets.sql
```

## Step 5: Configure Authentication

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**
2. Configure your authentication settings:
   - **Site URL**: `http://localhost:5173` (for development)
   - **Redirect URLs**: Add `http://localhost:5173/**`
3. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Providers**
4. Enable **Email** provider
5. Optionally enable other providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)

## Step 6: Set Up Row Level Security (RLS)

The migration files already set up RLS policies, but you can verify them:

1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Policies**
2. Ensure the following policies are created:
   - Users can view/update their own profile
   - Users can manage their own SOS alerts
   - Users can manage their own emergency contacts
   - Users can manage their own audio files

## Step 7: Test Your Connection

1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Try to sign up with a new account
4. Check the Supabase dashboard to see if the user was created

## Step 8: Deploy to Production

When deploying to production:

1. Update your environment variables with production URLs
2. Update Supabase authentication settings with your production domain
3. Run the migrations on your production database

## Database Schema Overview

### Users Table
- `id`: Unique user identifier
- `email`: User's email address
- `full_name`: User's full name
- `phone_number`: User's phone number
- `emergency_contacts`: Array of emergency contact IDs
- `created_at`: Account creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp

### SOS Alerts Table
- `id`: Unique alert identifier
- `user_id`: Reference to user who triggered the alert
- `location`: JSON object with latitude and longitude
- `status`: Alert status (active, resolved, false_alarm)
- `created_at`: Alert creation timestamp
- `resolved_at`: Alert resolution timestamp
- `audio_url`: URL to recorded audio file
- `transcription`: Text transcription of audio

### Emergency Contacts Table
- `id`: Unique contact identifier
- `user_id`: Reference to user who owns this contact
- `name`: Contact's full name
- `phone_number`: Contact's phone number
- `relationship`: Relationship to user
- `is_primary`: Whether this is the primary emergency contact
- `created_at`: Contact creation timestamp

## Storage Buckets

- **audio-files**: Stores recorded audio files for SOS alerts
- Files are organized by user ID: `{user_id}/{timestamp}_audio.webm`
- Only authenticated users can access their own files

## Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only access their own data
- **Authentication**: Supabase handles user authentication securely
- **API Keys**: Environment variables keep sensitive data secure
- **CORS**: Configured to allow only your domains

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing Supabase environment variables"**
   - Check your `.env` file exists and has correct values
   - Restart your development server after adding environment variables

2. **"Invalid API key"**
   - Verify your anon key is correct
   - Check that you're using the anon key, not the service role key

3. **"RLS policy violation"**
   - Ensure the user is authenticated
   - Check that RLS policies are properly set up
   - Verify the user ID matches the data they're trying to access

4. **"Bucket not found"**
   - Run the storage buckets migration
   - Check that the bucket name matches exactly

## Next Steps

After setting up the basic backend:

1. **Add more features**: Implement emergency contact management
2. **Enhance security**: Add phone number verification
3. **Scale up**: Consider adding real-time notifications
4. **Monitor**: Use Supabase analytics to track usage
5. **Backup**: Set up automated database backups
